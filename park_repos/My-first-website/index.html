<!-- The code in the head is what links all my files and images it also checks what kind of deivce the user is using so it can match the boarders to there device. The header is where I linked a picture of me with the img tags it also has my H1 which is my bigest text which is the tittle of my project
. The ul command makes an unorganized list and the li is the lists items. In the body I have my tittle for that part and multiple paragraphs describing who I am and what I like I then use the hr command to create a new line for my footer. The footer is where 
I have my links to my github and my linkedin. -->
